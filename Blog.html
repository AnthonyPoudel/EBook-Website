            <h2 style="font-size: 35px;">Impact Of Technology</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">When we speak of the impact of technology on society, we always talk about the positive effects of technology and about how technology has made life easy. We talk about the Internet as an information resource and a communication platform and conveniently ignore the fact that an overexposure to it leads to Internet addiction. We often discuss how technology has made life easy but easily forget that it has made us overly dependent on it.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: 35px;">Positive Impact Of Technology</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 25px;">Technology has a positive impact on student learning. Technology causes students to be 
                more engaged; thus, students often retain more information. Because of the arrival of new 
                technologies rapidly occurring globally, technology is relevant to the students. Technology 
                provides meaningful learning experiences. Technology also provides hands-on learning 
                opportunities that can be integrated into all school curricular areas, including mathematics, 
                reading, science, and social studies as well as other academic subjects. It gives students 
                opportunities to collaborate with their peers resulting in learning from each other. These factors 
                combined can lead to a positive impact on student learning and motivation. </p>

        <h2 style="font-size: 35px;">Negative Impact Of Technology</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">
            One of the most negative impacts of technology on our students is that it is slowly and gradually killing their social skills and prefers to stay isolated. They easily get addicted to technology which in return causes them to use it more and more.Technology is a major source of distraction too. Students know very well that technology is great and open-source of learning for them but as they get familiar with the use of technology, the majority of them use it negatively.Instead of learning things, they try to access the invalid things that are available on the internet. The ease to access invalid and inappropriate things not only distract them but also affects their learning capabilities.

            Therefore, parents and teachers must be wise enough to impose strict borderline when they handover the technology to the students. The positive outcomes of students are only possible if they have a strong check over them.

        <h2 style="font-size: 35px;">Conclusion</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Tools and data systems can be integrated seamlessly to provide information on student learning progress beyond the static and dated scores of traditional assessments. Learning dashboards and collaboration and communication tools can help connect teachers and families with instantaneous ease. This all is made more likely with the guidance of strong vision and leadership at all levels from teacher-leaders to school, district, and state administrators. For these roles, too, technology allows greater communication, resource sharing, and improved practice so that the vision is owned by all and dedicated to helping every individual in the system improve learning for students.

            It is a time of great possibility and progress for the use of technology to support learning.</p>
